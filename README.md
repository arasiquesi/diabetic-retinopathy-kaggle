Reproducible Research Project Initialization
=======

Research project initialization and organization following reproducible research guidelines.

Overview
--------

    project
    |- doc/             # documentation for the study
    |  +- paper/        # manuscript(s), whether generated or not
    |
    |- data             # raw and primary data, are not changed once created 
    |  |- raw/          # raw data, will not be altered
    |  +- clean/        # cleaned data, will not be altered once created
    |
    |- src/             # any programmatic code
    |- results          # all output from workflows and analyses
    |  |- figures/      # graphs, likely designated for manuscript figures
    |  +- pictures/     # diagrams, images, and other non-graph graphics
    |
    |- scratch/         # temporary files that can be safely deleted or lost
    |- README           # the top level description of content
    |- study.rst        # executable lmarkdown for this study, if applicable
    |- Makefile         # executable Makefile for this study, if applicable
    |- datapackage.json # metadata for the (input and output) data files 


How to use
----------

### From repository (preferred)

The preferred strategy is to:

1. clone the desired branch of this repository (depending on which kind of project you want to start).
2. Adapt to convenience for the inital commit.

  * Open this document in an editor. Change the first line to reflect the title of your research study, and delete the rest of the content in this file. You can, but are not obligated to keep the Acknowledgements section.
  * Delete the LICENSE.md file, unless it will also apply to your project. (However, it probbaly will not to all of it.)

3. squash the repo into a single commit (the new initial commit).
4. create an online version of the repo.
5. publish the repo.
6. Go forth and experiment, keeping files in their appropriate places.

#### Using GIT commands
```
git clone --single-branch --branch=master -o templateSource --depth=1 https://github.com/massich/rr-init.git my_project_name
cd my_project_name
vim ./README.md
git reset --hard $(git commit-tree HEAD^{tree} -m "initial commit")
```
TODO (create project in github + publish)

#### Using HUB (it has less verbose typing)

[HUB] is a command-line wrapper for git that makes easy to interact with GitHub.

```
hub clone --single-branch --branch=master -o templateSource --depth=1 massich/rr-init my_project_name
cd my_project_name
vim ./README.md
git reset --hard $(git commit-tree HEAD^{tree} -m "initial commit")
hub create my_project_name
git push -u origin
```

### Old style

* Create a new directory for your project.
* Download the [latest release] of this repository, and unzip it in the directory you just created.
* Open this document in an editor. Change the first line to reflect the title of your research study, and delete the rest of the content in this file. You can, but are not obligated to keep the Acknowledgements section.
* Delete the LICENSE.md file, unless it will also apply to your project. (However, it probbaly will not to all of it.)
* Go forth and experiment, keeping files in their appropriate places.

Key concepts and goals
----------------------

See [Noble 2009] for a full description of and argument for the principle template structure. Some concepts and goals that guided this work:
* (Good) There is a folder for the raw data, which do not get altered, or intermixed with data that is the result of manual or programmatic manipulation. I.e., derived data is kept separate from raw data, and raw data are not duplicated.
* (Good) Code is kept separate from data.
* (Better) Manuscript production output is kept separate from everything else.
* (Good) There is a scratch directory for experimentation. Everything in the scratch directory can be deleted at any time without negative impact. 
* (Better) There should be a `README` in evey directory, describing the purpose of the directory and its contents.
* (Best) There is a top-level `Makefile` or [Rmarkdown] file that documents the computational study in executable form. Those files may call out to other `Makefile`'s or `.Rmd` files in subdirectories.
* (Best) There is a formal metadata descriptor at the root of the package that describes all the important input and output data files.
* (Meta) ~~The template structure should have no special software or skill prerequisites to install. Specifically, deploying the template structure should not require installing git, or using the command line.~~ You should really think about investing the time in learning GIT basics. However if you feel that today is not the day to do so, you can still use it without GIT by downloading the template as zip, etc.

Where to go from here
---------------------

* look at ``./doc/README.md`` and adapt the documentation to your needs
* Modify this document to provide a summary of the project


Todo
